HD Map
======

The package provides classes useful for interacting with HD map. The map
can be either instantiated from an OpenDrive file, or received from the
simulator.

When a HD Map is not available, Pylot attempts to build a naive map using
its own components (e.g., lane detection, LiDAR). However, this feature is
still in early stages, and not good enough for driving.
